# General Architecture Overview: Mail My Voice

This overview will illustrate my specific approach to enterprise architecture. In general, I view the discipline of enterprise architecture to be that of a connector which bridges market opportunities to drive value to technical strategy across the development organization. In this overview you will see an abbreviated example of how I analyze an opportunity and problems to solve in order to define architectural patterns and solutions. Additionally, this will showcase my general development abilities, and can be used as an example of my implementation capabilities across a variety of technologies. This demonstration format utilizes the concept of a Design Sketch, something that I myself did not invent but use frequently.

<small>Credit for the Design Sketch format goes to one of my mentors and is available upon request</small>

Assumptions for this overview:
* Purpose is to communicate how I design and communicate software and systems architecture
* Specific architecture/software being demonstrated is of my choosing
