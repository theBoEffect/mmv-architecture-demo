# General Architecture Overview: Mail My Voice

This overview will illustrate my specific approach to enterprise architecture. In general, I view the discipline of enterprise architecture to be that of a connector which bridges market opportunities to drive value to technical strategy across the development organization. Accomplishing this task requires:

* The ability to understand a market opportunity
* The ability to understand and internalize the challenges associated with an opportunity (problems to solve)
* The ability to account for the unknown and plan for quality
* The ability to design technical solutions
* The ability to communicate solutions at all levels of an organization from executives to developers
* The ability to pivot quickly
* The ability to deconstruct a solution into consumable work units for development teams
* The ability to lead and mentor teams
* The ability to guide implementation and roll-out strategies to work in harmony with the development effort
* The ability to interact with customers in order to find new opportunities

In this overview you will see an abbreviated example of how I analyze an opportunity and problems to solve in order to define architectural patterns and solutions. Additionally, this will showcase my general development abilities, and can be used as an example of my implementation capabilities across a variety of technologies. While the overview will not be exhaustive relative to the list above, I think it will be sufficient for the purposes of a demonstration. This overview format utilizes the concept of a Design Sketch, something that I myself did not invent but use frequently.

Assumptions for this overview:
* Purpose is to communicate how I design and communicate software and systems architecture
* Specific architecture/software being demonstrated is of my choosing
