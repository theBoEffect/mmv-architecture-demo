# General Architecture Overview

This overview will illustrate my specific approach to enterprise architecture. In general, I view the discipline of enterprise architecture to be that of a connector which bridges market opportunities to drive value to technical strategy across the development organization.

As you proceed, you will see an abbreviated example of how I analyze an opportunity and problems to solve in order to define architectural patterns and solutions. This overview format utilizes the concept of a Design Sketch, something that I myself did not invent but use frequently.

The overview can be found [here](https://github.com/theBoEffect/mmv-architecture-demo/wiki)

###### _Credit for the Design Sketch format goes to one of my mentors and is available upon request_

### Assumptions

    * Purpose is to communicate how I design and communicate software and systems architecture
* Specific architecture/software being demonstrated is of my choosing

Code section of this repository is primarily to house reference materials.
